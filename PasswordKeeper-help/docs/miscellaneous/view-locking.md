# View locking

## Main window locking

The main window locks automatically in a time period specified in the preferences. The main window can also be locked using the ![lock](/img/icons/lock.svg) lock view function.

When the view is locked all sensitive data is hidden. E.g. the item contents, search and the category tree is collapsed.

The view can be unlocked by clicking the locked message. If an existing file is opened the password is required the view to unlock.
