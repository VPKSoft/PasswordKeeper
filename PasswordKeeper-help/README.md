### Local Development (localized)

npm run start -- --locale xy
```

This command starts a local development server and opens up a browser window with the specified locale code. Most changes are reflected live without having to restart the server.

### Build

```
$ npm run build
```

This command generates static content into the `build` directory and can be served using any static contents hosting service.

### Generate i18next localization data

```
npm run write-translations -- --locale xy
```

This command will extract and initialize the JSON translation files that you need to translate.

### Deployment

Using SSH:

```
$ USE_SSH=true yarn deploy

```

If you are using GitHub pages for hosting, this command is a convenient way to build the website and push to the `gh-pages` branch.
