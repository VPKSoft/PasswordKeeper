# Credits
The code in this folder is based on the code by *krissrex* from the project named [google-authenticator-exporter](https://github.com/krissrex/google-authenticator-exporter), see: https://github.com/krissrex/google-authenticator-exporter.

The project seems to be MIT licensed as is this software so there are no conflicts with the licenses.

## Modifications
* Converted to TypeScript
* Refactored mostly for the more strict linting rules and typing
* Added `makeOtpAuthKey` function
